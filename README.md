# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

Steve, a recent finance graduate, wants to apply what he has learned to help his parents diversify their stock funds. A list of several green energy stocks are analyzed with the use of Excel's extension: Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

### Purpose

Using VBA's full capability, we want to create a code to automate the analyses performed on the list of green energy stocks, and refactor it in such a way that it can be applied to the entire stock market for the last few years, and run in a practical and timely manner.
